  content: "<p class='lead'>
    My career is marked by a Bachelor Degree completed with a <a target='_blank' href='https://alumni.polimi.it/en/2021/11/09/al-poli-borse-di-studio-e-mentoring-per-i-110-e-lode-piu-veloci/'>perfect GPA at Politecnico di Milano</a>, and a Double Master’s Degree at EIT Digital, graduating with honors at both Aalto University and Politecnico di Milano.

    <p class='lead'>
    I have recently worked in Ericsson as Research Intern, where I conducted my <a target='_blank' href='https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/123176'>Master Thesis</a> on VR-IoT integration. The thesis was awarded 5/5 (excellent) from Aalto, and was presented at the Ericsson Technology Conference, one of the most exclusive events gathering company experts from all over the globe.
